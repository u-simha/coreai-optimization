    Abstract base class for compression simulators.

    This base class provides a common interface for all compression
    simulators, regardless of the specific compression technique. The
    compression simulator takes a tensor and applies the compression
    technique on the tensor, while allowing the model to be evaluated.

    Subclasses should implement the forward() method to define how the
    compression simulation is performed during training.
